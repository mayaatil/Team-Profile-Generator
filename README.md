# 10 Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

The Team Profile Generator is a helpful tool that generates a webpage that displays basic information of any given team, so that the user has quick access to information such as: emails, employee ID, name; and specific data such as GitHub profiles and schools attended, depending on the job position of the team member. The code uses Javascript to create a command-line application that accepts user input, which will present the user with question prompts regarding information about their employees. After user input is collected, a HTML is generated for the user in which they can visually see different cards created for each employee, and displayed in those cards will be the employee information. The application provides HTML links that redirect the user to emails and Github Profiles.
